This is a javascript based implementation of a client side "presentation model", after the
term coined by Martin Fowler to describe an object model for abstrating the functional behavior
of the UI, from the elements/components of it (in our case, the DOM).

This software is based on the Prototype and jQuery javascript libraries and is distributed 
under a BSD style licence.
